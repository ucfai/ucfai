This is a custom-built course which we offer every semester. The goal of this
course is to dip your toes into a variety of topics and prepare you to move into
the other, more advanced, groups soon after. **We expect you to attend as many
lectures as possible and chunk out a few hours – roughly 5-10 every week in addition to
these meetings – to become successful.**

The material here has been a part of the core of AI@UCF since Felix Sosa, John
Muchovej, and Richard DiBacco reworked the structure of the club at UCF. As the
university doesn't to provide such coursework until your final semesters in degree
programs, this was created to function as a stand-in, to cultivate your skillset
for research and industry before you graduate.
